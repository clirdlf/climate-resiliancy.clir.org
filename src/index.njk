          The 21st century has experienced a dramatic increase in extreme weather events. To address climate resiliency needs across libraries, museum, and cultural heritage institutions, CLIR and DLFâ€™s Climate Justice Working Group are hosting a series of free online climate resiliency workshops, informal climate circles, and conference meetings that will identify the key areas of action that librarians, archivists, and other cultural workers can take.
        </p>

        <p>
          Through the generous funding of the IMLS Libraries Leadership Grant, the team will be recruiting a committee to establish a curriculum of talks and informational sessions allowing for the discussion of a wide range of topics related to climate change, systemic injustice, big data and its implications on the environment, disaster management and preparation, climate awareness, and community engagement. 
        </p>
      
        <p>
          The program will include a series of six <strong>online workshops</strong> on topics such as disaster planning, climate adaptation, and sustainable practices. We will also include less format <strong>climate circles</strong> to connect with other professionals and share ideas.
        </p>

        <p>
          We are designing the program for librarians, archivists, and cultural heritage workers of all levels of experience. No prior knowledge of climate change or climate resilience is required.
